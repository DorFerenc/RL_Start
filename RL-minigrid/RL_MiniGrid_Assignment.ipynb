    "1. **Q-Learning** performed best overall due to:\n",
    "   - Off-policy learning (learns optimal regardless of exploration)\n",
    "   - Step-by-step updates (faster feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SARSA** was more conservative:\n",
    "   - Accounts for exploration in its value estimates\n",
    "   - Better when safety matters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monte Carlo** worked but was slower:\n",
    "   - Must wait for episode end\n",
    "   - Higher variance in estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reward Shaping** was crucial for KeyEnv:\n",
    "   - Without it, the agent struggles with sequential tasks\n",
    "   - Small intermediate rewards guide learning\n",
